# Verilog

This is one of the most dedicated projects which i am doing for my betterment. 
This is the 50 day project which is starting from August 15, 2024.
In this project, i will take all of the possible digital circuits and write the Verilog code for the same.
After writing the Verilog code, i will upload the same in the github with the results of simulation, along with the source code and also the documentation of the circuit simulated.

Thanks for your time.... have a great day.
